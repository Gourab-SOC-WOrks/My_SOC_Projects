## Indicators of Malicious Intent

### 1. Typosquatting

* The domain uses **"micros0ft"** with a zero instead of an "o".
* Designed to visually impersonate a trusted Microsoft domain.

### 2. Brand Impersonation

* Uses the term **"tech-support"** to appear legitimate.
* No affiliation with official Microsoft domains.

### 3. Credential Harvesting Pattern

* The `/verify` path strongly suggests a fake login or verification page.

### 4. Mismatch with Legitimate Practices

* Microsoft does not send direct verification links for account recovery via third-party domains.

## Threat Assessment

* URL structure matches common phishing and credential harvesting campaigns.

**Risk Level:** 🔴 High
